is there anything confidential that could be leaked or gleaned from this photo. I'm looking for badges, details on whiteboards or computer screens or any sort of internal org details that shouldn't be leaked to the public. all you need to do is flag it for further review even if the resolution isn't the best. output flagged if you think it could contain interesting information.
